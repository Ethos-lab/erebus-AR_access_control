# NatDevice
NatDevice is a high performance, cross-platform camera and microphone API for Unity Engine. To start, discover available media devices:
```csharp
// Create a media device query for a camera device
var filter = MediaDeviceCriteria.CameraDevice;
var query = new MediaDeviceQuery(filter);
// Get the first camera device
var device = query.current as CameraDevice;
```

Then stream camera images or audio buffers from the device:
```csharp
// Start streaming camera images
device.StartRunning(OnCameraImage);

void OnCameraImage (CameraImage image) {
    // Do stuff
    ...
}
```

From here, you can utilize extensive functionality provided by the API to build your interactive applications. Features include:

+ **Ultra-low Latency**. Stream the camera preview and microphone audio into Unity with extremely small overhead.

+ **Ultra-high Resolution**. NatDevice supports high resolution camera previews, at full HD and higher on devices that support it.

+ **Extensive Camera Control**. Set the camera exposure mode, exposure point, exposure duration, focus mode, focus point, flash mode, white balance mode, torch mode, zoom, and more.

+ **Granular Microphone Control**. Configure the microphone sample rate, channel count, and echo cancellation mode on devices that support it.

+ **Machine Learning Integration**. NatDevice tightly integrates with [NatML](https://github.com/natmlx/NatML) for building machine learning and computer vision apps.

+ **Video Recording Integration**. NatDevice tightly integrates with [NatCorder](https://github.com/natmlx/NatCorder) for enabling user-generated content.
